            Cryptocurrency is a form of digital or virtual currency that uses
            cryptography for security. Unlike traditional currencies issued by
            governments (fiat currency), cryptocurrencies operate on
            decentralized networks, typically based on blockchain technology.
            This means no central authority, like a bank or government, controls
            them. Instead, transactions are recorded on a public ledger, making
            them transparent and secure.
